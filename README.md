This comprehensive mini Rproject provides detailed insights into the code snippets, explaining the setup of distribution parameters, calculating probabilities, and visualizing distributions. The comparison of simulated data with theoretical expectations enhances the understanding of how well the chosen probability distributions model real-world scenarios.
